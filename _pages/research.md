### 2017: How species of malaria vector mosquitoes emerged and evolved in the Anopheles gambiae complex
PIs: **_Michael Fontaine_**, Sander van Doorn, & Bregje Wertheim  
> *Summary*: Evidence of introgressive hybridization is widespread in the tree of life, occurring especially among closely related species in various clades such as hominids, Anopheline mosquitoes and Heliconius butterflies. High-resolution genomic-data have recently been produced and enabled scientists to perform in-depth investigation of the extent and evolutionary consequences of introgression on the adaptation and speciation processes. However, major challenges remain to redefine key biological concepts and our understating of speciation: How can species diverge and adapt to distinct ecological niches if their reproductive barriers are porous? What genomic features and processes keep species as separate entities if their genomes are a blend of private genomic sequences that have evolved within the species and genomic information borrowed from related organisms but with an independent evolutionary past? What are the adaptive implications of introgression and how to quantify them?
> This project explores the genetic architecture of divergence, adaptation and speciation with gene-flow in the medically important A. gambiae species complex, mosquito vectors of the deadly Plasmodium sp. parasite causing malaria. We will use state-of-the-art population genetic approaches to analyse mosquitoes’ genetic diversity using new comprehensive genomic data about the species complex. From a theoretical perspective, we will use mechanistic models to simulate conditions under which species of A. gambiae complex diverged and specialize ecologically in face of gene flow; we will also simulate introgression occurring between individuals to analyse the resilience of allele networks occurring in nature and, using agent-based models, we will aim to understand how patterns of gene flow can become established and be affected by changes in the environment. Finally, we will try to integrate the results produced in the previous three approaches in a definitive theory of speciation that incorporates the concept of gene exchange and porous reproductive barriers.

### 2016: Reproductive parasitism in a love triangle – Wolbachia, master manipulator or microbe mediator?
PIs: Leo Beukeboom, Joana Falcao Salles & **_Michael Fontaine_**  
> *Summary*: We will study the triangular interactions between cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing Wolbachia bacteria, the host nuclear genome and the remainder of the microbiome in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Questions that will be addressed are how vertical inheritance and environmental acquisition shape microbiome composition in Wolbachia-infected and –uninfected individuals; how different microbiome compositions affect reproductive manipulation by Wolbachia; whether novel Wolbachia infections lead to shifts in microbiome composition; and how Wolbachia affects host gene expression in interaction with the microbiome.

### 2016: Human induced eco-evolutionary feedbacks restructure ecosystems and limit their recovery
PIs: Klemens Eriksson, **_Michael Fontaine_** & Martine Maan
> *Summary*: Declines in top-predators have enabled the threespine stickleback to increase hundred-fold in the Baltic Sea the past decade. Today, stickleback have reorganized the coastal food-web dramatically, causing algal overgrowth and decreased water quality. We hypothesize that the problems are caused by a benthic ecotype of stickleback that have adapted rapidly to the new biological conditions and thereby locked coastal areas in a societally undesirable state. The project will combine ecological field studies, behavioral experiments and population genetics to characterize the ecological and evolutionary impacts of the benthic ecotype and the underlying genetic mechanisms.
