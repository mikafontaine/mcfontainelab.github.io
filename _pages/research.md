### 2016: Reproductive parasitism in a love triangle – Wolbachia, master manipulator or microbe mediator?
PIs: Leo Beukeboom, Joana Falcao Salles & **_Michael Fontaine_**  
> *Summary*: We will study the triangular interactions between cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing Wolbachia bacteria, the host nuclear genome and the remainder of the microbiome in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Questions that will be addressed are how vertical inheritance and environmental acquisition shape microbiome composition in Wolbachia-infected and –uninfected individuals; how different microbiome compositions affect reproductive manipulation by Wolbachia; whether novel Wolbachia infections lead to shifts in microbiome composition; and how Wolbachia affects host gene expression in interaction with the microbiome.

### 2016: Human induced eco-evolutionary feedbacks restructure ecosystems and limit their recovery
PIs: Klemens Eriksson, **_Michael Fontaine_** & Martine Maan
> *Summary*: Declines in top-predators have enabled the threespine stickleback to increase hundred-fold in the Baltic Sea the past decade. Today, stickleback have reorganized the coastal food-web dramatically, causing algal overgrowth and decreased water quality. We hypothesize that the problems are caused by a benthic ecotype of stickleback that have adapted rapidly to the new biological conditions and thereby locked coastal areas in a societally undesirable state. The project will combine ecological field studies, behavioral experiments and population genetics to characterize the ecological and evolutionary impacts of the benthic ecotype and the underlying genetic mechanisms.
